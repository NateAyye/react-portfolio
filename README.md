A Demonstration of a portfolio built with React. This portfolio is a single page application that uses Conditional rendering to navigate between the "pages". The portfolio is deployed to GitHub Pages.

This is to showcase my skills and projects all in one place so that employers can see what I am capable of. This portfolio is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more and create more projects.
